# Session 5 — Rule Pack & Validator Interface (MVP)

**Project:** AI-Powered TTB Alcohol Label Verification Prototype
**Scope:** Rule Data & Validation Engine
**Authoritative regulatory source:** eCFR (current text of 27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 16, as amended through T.D. TTB-176, 87 FR 7579 (Feb. 9, 2022) for Parts 5 and 7 modernization).

---

## TL;DR

- **YAML-as-data is the right format** for every MVP rule except the cpi lookup, which is encoded as a YAML decision table with explicit `interpolation: none` semantics; verbatim regulatory text (the §16.21 GOVERNMENT WARNING) lives in a separate hashed asset file referenced by SHA-256 from the rule.
- **ABV tolerances are correct as stated in T9 §1** and verified against the current eCFR text: spirits ±0.3 pp (§5.65(c)), malt beverage ±0.3 pp with the §7.65(c) hard 0.5% floor, wine ±1.0 pp >14% / ±1.5 pp ≤14% (§4.36(b)(1)) with the §4.36(c) class-boundary anti-overlap constraint encoded as a hard post-condition.
- **Validator interface is Pydantic v2** (`FieldObservation` + `ExpectedValue` → `ValidationResult`), validators are referenced by string name (`equality_match`, `cpi_lookup`, `abv_band`, `verbatim_hash`, `fuzzy_brand`), the RuleLoader fail-closes on schema violation per T3 §Q3.10, and confidence aggregates via `min` (never multiplication) per T5 §Q5.7.

### 2. Cpi table — YAML decision table or Python validator?

**Recommendation: YAML decision table with explicit `interpolation: none` semantics**, called by a generic `validator: cpi_lookup` reference. The §16.22(a)(4) table is a closed enumeration of three points (1 mm → 40 cpi, 2 mm → 25 cpi, 3 mm → 12 cpi) with no regulatory authority to interpolate between them; the regulation is itself written as a tabular rule. Encoding it in YAML keeps the rules-as-data invariant from D-002, makes the comparison auditable by a reviewer who is not a Python developer, and leaves the validator (a generic key-lookup) as one of ~5 named primitives. A bespoke Python function would (a) hide a regulatory citation inside compiled code, (b) defeat the rule-pack version diff workflow, and (c) tempt future contributors to add interpolation, which would silently invent an unauthorized standard.

### 3. ABV tolerance encoding — verified against current eCFR

Confirmed against eCFR (current as of 2026-04): §4.36(b)(1) and (c), §5.65(c), §7.65(c). The §4.36 numbering survived the 2022 modernization (only Parts 5 and 7 were renumbered under T.D. TTB-176, 87 FR 7579); §4.36(c) anti-overlap language is unchanged from T.D. ATF-275 (1988). The encoding is in deliverable (a) below.

### 4. Verbatim warning string storage

**Recommendation: separate hashed asset file referenced by SHA-256 from the rule.** The verbatim text from §16.21 is:

> `GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.`

Store as `assets/warnings/govt_warning_16_21.txt` (UTF-8, LF, no trailing newline). The rule references it with both a path and a SHA-256 of the canonicalized bytes. This (a) prevents YAML escaping/whitespace drift from corrupting the verbatim string, (b) makes the file diffable in CI, (c) lets the loader hash-verify on startup and fail-closed if the file is mutated, and (d) keeps the regulatory text at exactly one location in the repository (single source of truth, per D-005).

For the canonical bytes (single trailing newline excluded; ASCII; smart quotes normalized to ASCII), the SHA-256 is computed and pinned at rule-loader startup; the value is recorded in `reason_codes.yaml` and the rule file, and any drift triggers `WARNING.VERBATIM.HASH_DRIFT` and refuses startup. **Do not hard-code the hash in this document** — compute it once during repo bootstrap from the canonicalized file and commit both the file and the hash together; the `RuleLoader` then enforces the equality at every startup.

### 5. Brand-name fuzzy match policy

The T3 suggestion (RapidFuzz `token_set_ratio` ≥ 0.85) is appropriate but should run as the **last** stage of a layered pipeline:

1. **Exact match** on raw OCR string vs. expected brand → `match: exact` (confidence inherited from OCR).
2. **Normalized exact** (Unicode NFKC, casefold, strip punctuation, collapse whitespace, drop legal suffixes like "®", "™", "Co.", "Inc.") → `match: normalized`.
3. **Fuzzy fallback**: RapidFuzz `fuzz.token_set_ratio(normalized_a, normalized_b) / 100.0 ≥ 0.85` → `match: fuzzy` with score reported in `Evidence.match_score`.

`token_set_ratio` is the right scorer for brand fields (handles word reordering and extra adjectives like "Brand", which §4.39(j) explicitly allows). The threshold 0.85 sits below the empirical floor for human-judged "same brand with OCR noise" and above the typical ceiling for unrelated brands; lower it only if the S4 fixtures show false negatives, never raise it without a fixture-driven precision/recall study. Never use fuzzy matching for the §16.21 verbatim string — that is hash-only.

### 6. YAML rule shape — confirmed and refined

Adopt the T3-suggested shape and add the following production fields:

- `effective_date` (ISO-8601, when the rule begins applying — usually the CFR amendment date)
- `supersedes` (optional list of rule_ids retired by this rule)
- `rule_pack_version` (semver of the parent pack; the loader pins the matrix)
- `test_fixtures` (list of fixture IDs in S4 that exercise this rule, both pass and fail cases — required, fail-closed if empty)
- `notes` (free-text reviewer commentary; ignored by the engine)
- `disabled` (bool, default false; disabled rules load but never fire — used for staged rollout)
- `confidence_floor` (per T5 §Q5.5 minimum aggregated confidence below which result is `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`)

The full shape is shown in the deliverable (a) examples.

### 7. Reason-code registry — separate file

**Recommendation: separate `reason_codes.yaml` registry**, loaded once and referenced by code in every rule. Inlining produces drift (two rules with the same intent end up with subtly different `WARNING.TYPE_SIZE.UNDER_1MM` vs. `WARNING.TYPESIZE.UNDER_1MM` codes), prevents catalog-style C-EvidencePanel hover text, and breaks the §7.3 taxonomy invariant. Loader fail-closes if any rule references a code not present in the registry.

### 8. Rule versioning — research prototype

**Recommendation: YAML header field `rule_pack_version: <semver>` plus git tags; no version in filename.** Rationale:

- Filename versioning (`wine-v1.2.0.yaml`) creates path churn for every change and breaks `git blame` continuity.
- Git tags alone don't survive `kubectl cp` or zip exports.
- A `rule_pack_version` field inside each file (or a top-level `pack.yaml` for the directory) lets the running engine emit it in every `ValidationResult.engine_meta` for traceability, and the git tag remains the canonical release marker.

For an MVP, individual rule-file versioning is overkill; version the **pack** (the `rules/` tree) as a unit using semver bumped on every CFR-derived change.

### 9. Pydantic v2 input contract — confirmed with prototype refinements

Per T3 §Q3.2: `FieldObservation + ExpectedValue → ValidationResult`. Pydantic v2 confirmed. Prototype-specific deviations:

- Use `model_config = ConfigDict(extra='forbid', frozen=True)` on all four models — strict, immutable, fail-loud.
- `Evidence` and `ValidationResult` are frozen so they can be cached and shared across the audit trail.
- `Decimal` (not `float`) for ABV values to avoid 14.0 vs 13.999999 boundary bugs.
- `confidence` typed as `Annotated[float, Field(ge=0.0, le=1.0)]`.
- `bbox` typed as `tuple[int, int, int, int]` (x, y, w, h in pixels of the source image at native resolution; crop coordinates in T4 normalized form).
- Defer FastAPI request models to a thin shim layer — the engine itself takes raw `FieldObservation` instances, not HTTP payloads.

Full implementation in deliverable (c).

### 10. Evidence shape — for C-EvidencePanel

Beyond the T3 minimum (`bbox`, `extracted_text`, `confidence`, `matched_against_value`), the UI needs:

- `field_id` (which rule consumed this evidence)
- `source` (one of `ocr`, `layout`, `classifier`, `derived`)
- `page_id` / `panel` (which label face the bbox is on — front/back/neck/wrap)
- `image_uri` (so the UI can crop and zoom)
- `match_kind` (`exact`, `normalized`, `fuzzy`, `hash`, `numeric_band`, `lookup`, `none`)
- `match_score` (optional float for fuzzy/lookup)
- `normalized_text` (post-NFKC/casefold form actually compared)
- `notes` (engine breadcrumb, e.g. "applied 14% boundary clamp")

### 11. Confidence aggregation — min vs. multiplication

**Confirmed: min-aggregate is correct for this engine.** Reasons:

1. **Independence assumption fails.** Multiplication (`p_ocr * p_layout * p_match`) assumes the three signals are statistically independent; they are not — OCR confidence and layout confidence are both functions of the same input image. Multiplying correlated probabilities artificially deflates confidence and makes thresholds unstable.
2. **Bounded weakest-link semantics.** A rule's pass/fail correctness is upper-bounded by its weakest signal. If the OCR engine is 0.6 confident the warning text reads `GOVERNMENT WARN1NG`, then no amount of high-confidence layout detection can rescue the verbatim match. `min(0.6, 0.99, 0.95) = 0.6` is the honest answer.
3. **Calibration friendliness.** `min` preserves the OCR engine's calibration; multiplying does not. Confidence-band thresholds (T3 §Q3.5) stay interpretable.
4. **Determinism per T5 §Q5.7.** Min is associative, commutative, and order-independent — it composes the same way regardless of the order in which evidence arrives, which the deterministic-first principle requires.
5. **Failure mode honesty.** When OCR returns 0.0 ("character could not be read"), multiplication zeros the whole result; min does too — but min lets the UI surface *which* signal failed, because it's the argmin.

### 12. Engine failure modes — MVP subset of the 13 from T3 §Q3.10

For an MVP, **8 of 13 are essential, 5 deferrable.** Essential, fail-closed at startup or per-request:

1. Malformed YAML / loader schema violation → refuse to start
2. Missing required field on `FieldObservation` → return `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`
3. Validator timeout (per-rule budget exceeded) → return `TIMEOUT`, fail-closed
4. Reason-code not in registry → refuse to start
5. Verbatim asset hash mismatch → refuse to start
6. OCR/upstream dependency failure on a required field → return `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` for affected rules only, do not crash the engine
7. Confidence below `confidence_floor` → return `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`
8. Rule-pack version mismatch with engine-supported range → refuse to start

Deferrable to post-MVP: rule-rule dependency cycles, partial-result merging across distributed workers, rule shadowing detection, fuzzy-match tie-breaking telemetry, COLA-form-driven dynamic rule selection. The MVP runs single-process, single-pack, so these are not yet exercisable.

### 13. Per-rule timeout budget — pick one

**Pick 250 ms per rule.** Justification:

- Pure equality / lookup / numeric-band rules (the majority) finish in <5 ms, leaving generous headroom.
- Fuzzy brand match using RapidFuzz `token_set_ratio` with a candidate set of one expected value is sub-millisecond on CPython; even with 100 expected aliases it stays under 50 ms.
- The verbatim hash check (`common.warning.verbatim`) plus normalization runs <10 ms.
- 250 ms gives a 5× safety margin on the slowest plausible MVP rule (a fuzzy match against a long alias list with normalization), while keeping a 30-rule sequential evaluation under 7.5 s wall-clock — well within the engine SLO.
- 100 ms is too tight (one GC pause and a fuzzy rule trips the budget unnecessarily); 300 ms is acceptable but masks unintended slowdowns and is harder to alert on. 250 ms threads the needle.

Per-pack global budget: `n_rules * 250 ms + 500 ms loader overhead`.

3. `rule_pack_version` outside the engine-supported semver range.
4. Pydantic schema violation in any rule entry.
5. Duplicate `rule_id` across the tree.
6. Unknown `validator` primitive name.
7. `reason_code` failing grammar regex or not present in registry.
8. Asset file missing OR SHA-256 of canonicalized content not equal to `sha256_pin`.
9. Empty `test_fixtures`, or fixtures not in the S4 manifest (when supplied).
10. `supersedes` pointing at unknown rule_id.

## Caveats

- **CFR text was verified against eCFR current content as of April 2026.** Parts 5 and 7 were renumbered by T.D. TTB-176 (87 FR 7579, Feb. 9, 2022); Part 4 was not. The §5.65(c) and §7.65(c) tolerance language and the §5.63 / §7.63 mandatory-information lists reflect that modernization. Part 16 has not been amended materially since T.D. TTB-91 (76 FR 5477, Feb. 1, 2011).
- **Surgeon General cancer-warning advisory (Jan. 2025):** the U.S. Surgeon General called for Congress to add a cancer warning to alcohol labels; that proposal would require statutory action and is **not** part of 27 CFR §16.21 today. The verbatim string in deliverable (a) reflects the *currently enforceable* §16.21 text, not the proposal. If/when Congress amends ABLA, a new rule-pack version (1.0.0+) will replace `common.warning.verbatim` and the asset file's hash.
- **Cpi table extrapolation:** §16.22(a)(4) enumerates only three (height, cpi) pairs. The decision-table policy `on_between_keys: round_up_to_next_key` is the *strictest* defensible interpretation (1.5 mm → 25 cpi cap, not interpolated to ~32). It is one defensible policy among several; TTB has not published guidance for fractional millimeter measurements, so the choice was made conservatively. Document this in S6 review.
- **Wine §4.36(b) range form (Alcohol __% to __% by volume):** the MVP's `wine.alcohol.tolerance_band` rule covers only the *direct* statement form. The range form (with §4.36(b)(2) range limits of 2 pp >14% / 3 pp ≤14%) is not in the MVP scope; add as `wine.alcohol.range_band` in a future pack.
- **Wine §4.36(b) sub-7% products:** under §24.257(a)(3), wines with <7% ABV stated on the label use a separate ±0.75 pp tolerance under Part 24, not §4.36; that is a Part 24/IRC labeling regime distinct from the FAA-Act regime in Part 4. The MVP's rule pack does not currently cover sub-7% wines; add only if S4 fixtures require it.
- **§4.36 "tolerance" vs "range":** the eCFR text reads "a tolerance of 1 percent" (per the eCFR snippet); historical/some commentary phrases this as "1 percentage point". TTB's own consumer-facing guidance pages use "percentage points", consistent with T9 §1's `pp` notation. The YAML uses `pp` to disambiguate.
- **`asset.sha256_pin` is a placeholder.** It must be computed at repo bootstrap from the canonicalized bytes of `assets/warnings/govt_warning_16_21.txt` (UTF-8, ASCII quotes, NFKC, single-spaced, trimmed) and committed. Until then, `RuleLoader` will fail-closed at startup — which is the correct behavior.
- **Validator names are placeholders for primitives, not implementations.** Per the user's CRITICAL constraint, none of the named primitives (`equality_match`, `cpi_lookup`, `abv_band`, etc.) are implemented in this deliverable; they exist as named handles in the YAML and as a whitelist in `RuleLoader._KNOWN_VALIDATORS`. Implementations are out of scope for S5.
- **`fuzzy_threshold: 0.85`** is normalized to the [0,1] interval; RapidFuzz returns 0–100, so the implementing primitive must divide by 100 (or compare against 85). Keep this normalization consistent across the codebase.
