"""The §16.21 GOVERNMENT WARNING asset is the single source of truth for the
verbatim text that FR-201 enforces. Mutating either side of the hash pin
(asset content or rule-pack pin) must be detectable; this test only verifies
that the asset exists and contains both required sentences. Hash-drift detection
lives in tests/test_rule_loader_failclose.py.
