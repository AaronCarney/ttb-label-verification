"""Namespace re-export of the canonical rule-pack types declared in
``app.schemas.rules``. Closes E1 §4 AC #9.

This module MUST use ``from app.schemas.rules import X as X`` style (rebinding
the class object) — NOT a redeclaration — so the ``is``-identity assertion
holds. Any future refactor that redeclares these names here is a regression.
