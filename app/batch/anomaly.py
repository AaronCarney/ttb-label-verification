"""Sliding-window anomaly detector — FR-405.

Default M=5, N=10. Fires an advisory when M of the last N observations share
the same reason code. The advisory carries a UUID4 ``advisory_id`` so the
dismiss endpoint can validate the dismissal corresponds to the still-outstanding
advisory (idempotent against double-dismissal; rejects stale tabs).
