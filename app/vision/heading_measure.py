"""Stroke-width measurement for the §16.22(a)(2) bold-heading check.

Restores a leaner version of the historical SWT runner (commit 2e0e738; deleted
in 6461496 when the local OCR profile was dropped). The measurement is
deterministic, runs on `label.image_bytes` after the cloud layout call returns
a bbox, and produces a real `is_bold` signal independent of LLM judgment. See
README §"Bold detection" for the design rationale.

Algorithm (Otsu + distance-transform + width:height ratio):

  1. Open the heading bbox crop in grayscale.
  2. Otsu's threshold → binary foreground mask of stroke pixels.
  3. Connected components: per-component bounding box gives character height.
  4. Distance transform: per foreground pixel, distance to nearest background;
     mean of positive distances * 2 ≈ mean stroke width per component.
  5. Aggregate: mean(stroke_width) / mean(char_height). Bold when ratio
     exceeds WIDTH_HEIGHT_RATIO_BOLD_MIN.

This is uncalibrated against a labeled corpus — the threshold is borrowed from
the deleted SWT module (0.30) and works on the demo fixtures. A tighter cut
would land in the same eval-corpus sweep that calibrates BRISQUE/NIQE and
brand-match thresholds (PRD §3.2 deferred).
